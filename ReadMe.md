## Description
TechFlow is a object-oriented program that simulates a basic online store that sells computer-related products. The program is written in C++ and follows the principle of encapsulation.
### Classes

## Task 1
### Classes
- [X] You must respect the principle of encapsulation.
- [ ] Define at least 5 classes.
- [ ] All classes will have constructors.
- [ ] At least 3 classes must be correlated by composition.

### Methods
- [ ] At least 3 methods that operate on class member data.
- [ ] At least one method will be overloaded.

### Input and Output
- [ ] For at least one class overload the operator << and operator >>.

### Dynamic Allocation
- [ ] At least one class must dynamically allocate memory.
- [ ] At least one class that dynamically allocates memory will have a copy constructor and an operator = implemented.
- [ ] All dynamically allocated memory must be properly deallocated.
- [ ] At least one class must have a non-trivial destructor.

### Interactive Menu
- [ ] Read from keyboard and create at least 3 types of objects among those defined.
- [ ] Display these objects, after they have been read by the application.
- [ ] Call a method on them.
- [ ] Implement the move constructor and overload the move operator = for at least one class that manages dynamically allocated memory.
